Scaling with Infrastructure-as-Code in Kubernetes-Driven Architectures

The dynamic scaling of cloud-based architectures is an integral aspect of cost optimization, as these structures' expenses are intrinsically
tied to their usage. Therefore, even minor optimizations can lead to substantial savings in overall cloud expenditure.
The objective here is to conduct a comparative assessment of two different scaling strategies: one rooted in the application code, and the
other employing the capabilities of Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) in a Kubernetes context. This investigation will focus on at least two
different language implementations, with each language representing one approach. In each case, one implementation will exhibit native
scalability within its language, while the other maintains a distributed layout, but scales within the Kubernetes infrastructure via IaC.
The study seeks to identify the most effective architecture and provide guidelines for its implementation, placing a particular emphasis on
managing the complexity and maintainability of the code.
