Introduction of Container Evolution and Infrastructure Management via Code:
Background: Start by outlining the history and evolution of container technologies. Highlight key milestones like the development of Docker, Kubernetes, and other container orchestration tools.
Relevance of IaC: Discuss the rise of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and how it has revolutionized managing and provisioning infrastructure through code, leading to more efficient and reproducible environments.
Setup of a Comparative Case Study:
Objective: Clearly define what you aim to compare in your case study and why. This could be comparing performance, scalability, or cost efficiency between different Kubernetes scaling strategies or between IaC tools.
Methodology: Describe how you will implement these strategies, including the tools and technologies you will use. Make sure to detail any baseline configurations for fairness in comparison.
Description of the Measurement Environment:
Experimental Setup: Outline the hardware and software environments where the tests will be conducted. Include information on the Kubernetes clusters, the node specifications, and any other relevant infrastructure details.
Metrics: Define what metrics you will measure (e.g., deployment time, resource usage, scaling efficiency) and how these metrics will be collected.
Analysis of Results:
Data Presentation: Use graphs, tables, and statistical analyses to present the collected data. Make sure your data visualizations are clear and effectively communicate the differences observed.
Discussion: Interpret the results, discussing how they meet or do not meet your hypotheses or expectations. Analyze the implications of your findings in the context of existing literature.
Further Improvements and Conclusion:
Recommendations: Based on your findings, suggest improvements for the strategies or tools you tested. These could be optimizations for configurations or proposing areas for further development.
Final Thoughts: Conclude your thesis by summarizing the key findings and their implications for the field. Reflect on the limitations of your study and suggest directions for future research.
