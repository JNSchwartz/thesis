Scaling with infrastructure as a code in Kubernetes-based architectures

Cloud-based architectures have to be scaled dynamically every time up and down since their cost is based on usage. Small improvements can mean a huge decrease in
the overall cloud cost.
I would like to compare scalings designed in the implementation code versus scaling in the infrastructure. Preferably in 1-2 implementation pairs with 1 or 2 languages (a
JVM-based solution and a functional language). An implementation pair that scales natively from the language and one which keeps the implementation distributed but
scales with the Kubernetes infrastructure as a code.
As a result, I want to suggest which architecture to choose and how to implement them. I would like to focus on code complexity and maintainability too.
